# trip-reservation report

First steps (2hs):
I carefully read the instructions and get excited. This test will is a great challenge! I have little experience working with cloud applications in java and my deployment skills are average but I hope to shine with my OOP design skills :).

First of all I've noticed some spots that might be problematic for me:
* The requeriments ask for authorization for customers and system admins, but says nothing about hotel agents that provides available trips and hotels.
*  I do not have experience in this domain, nor know much about this kind of applications.

Domain information (2hs):
As I was not familiar with the domain, I searched for some trip/hotel reservation web pages and grab some ideas of how this system might need to work.
